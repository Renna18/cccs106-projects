## How to Run Applications

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+ installed
2. Virtual environment activated: `cccs106_env\Scripts\activate`
3. Flet installed: `pip install flet==0.28.3`

### Running GUI Applications
```cmd
# Navigate to project directory
cd week2_labs

# Run applications
python hello_flet.py
python personal_info_gui.py

Commit and push README.md

# Add the updated README.md file to the staging area
# This stages the modified README.md file so it will be included in the next commit
# Git tracks changes to this file and prepares it for version control
git add README.md

# Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message
# Creates a permanent snapshot of the README.md updates in the repository history
# The commit message should clearly describe what was changed for future reference
git commit -m "Update README.md with new application information"

# Push the committed changes to the remote GitHub repository
# Synchronizes your local main branch with the remote repository on GitHub
# This makes your updated README.md visible to others and backs up your changes
git push origin main
